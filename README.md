In this GitHub you can find an agent-based model that uses reinforcement learning to see how agents' food reinforcement learning changes over time based on experienced food rewards.
It extends a previous agent-based model by Hammond et al. (2012) with Rescorla-Wagner and extinction. This enabled us to simulate interventions targeted at the individual and at the food environment.
